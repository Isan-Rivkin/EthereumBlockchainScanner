        <p style="text-align: justify;">As the official Ethereum project website&nbsp;says:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">“Ethereum&nbsp;is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship, or third-party interference.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">But what’s special about that? All software runs as it was programmed to do so…</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the code written on the Ethereum blockchain can’t be altered, tempered, or hacked. This tamper-proof feature <em>ensured by cryptography</em> makes it an interesting application of the blockchain technology.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ethereum is not just a blockchain; it’s a decentralized programmable blockchain-based software platform. In a way, you can say that its married to its cryptocurrency asset (called Ether – ETH) which runs the Ethereum network.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ethereum allows you to build and execute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract"><em>smart contracts</em></a> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">Distributed Autonomous Applications</a> (DApps)</em>, without censorship, downtime, or any third party.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The inbuilt&nbsp;programming language <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity">Solidity</a>&nbsp;</em>is used to write smart contracts and&nbsp;DApps. After that, the cryptocurrency asset (Ether) helps in executing these apps and contracts.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why Ethereum is also called <strong>programmable money.</strong></p>

          <strong>What is Bitcoin?
            <img class="aligncenter wp-image-807 size-full" title="What is Bitcoin" src="https://bitcoin.org/img/icons/opengraph.png" alt="What is Bitcoin" width="225" height="225" scale="0"></strong></h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.</p>
          <h3>Why Bitcoins?</h3>
          <div class="bitTxt txtMain">
            <p>Bitcoins can be used to buy merchandise anonymously. In addition, international payments are easy and cheap because bitcoins are not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Small businesses may like them because there are no credit card fees. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping that they’ll go up in value.</p>
